# FAQs
Q: Why Doll?

A: Because she's my favorite character in Murder Drones.

Q: Will other Murder Drones characters be coming?

A: Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on my mood.

---

Q: How do I run this projects?

A: 

  Windows: Open the exe file and don't grant permissions, because it doesn't need it.

  Linux: Open the executable in the dist folder. If you're using Hyprland, run the executable in the terminal by using the command "./path/to/file" (replace "path/to/file" with the actual path of the executable.)

Q: Will this become an app instead of a website on a local server?

A: Yes, this idea is currently in the works and will take a long time to make. The app will contain: an expressive avatar overlay (much like Smug AI), a system monitor with warnings, and an expressive voice so she can roast the shit of your specs and attitude.

Q: Will this project come to Mobile or MacOS?

A: Android: Yes, but it will take some time. IOS and MacOS: No, F*ck Apple!
